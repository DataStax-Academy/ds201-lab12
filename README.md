# DS201 Exercise 12

## Consistency

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
* Add a third node to the Cassandra cluster
*	Re-create the *killrvideo* keyspace using the `NetworkTopologyStrategy`
*	Use *nodetool* to determine where partition replicas can be found

Cassandra provides scalability and fault tolerance. Consistency is the secret sauce that makes this work.
