# DS201 Exercise 12

## Consistency

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
* Determine the current consistency level used by *cqlsh*
* Change the consistency level for reads and writes executed by *cqlsh*
* Observe how the availability of data changes with different consistency levels 


One of the challenges of distributed systems, like Apache Cassandraâ„¢, is how to balance keeping your data consistent across multiple replicas while maintaining high availability. Fortunately, Cassandra lets you tune this balancing to your needs by setting consistency levels for reads and writes.
